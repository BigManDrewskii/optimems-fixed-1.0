After months of testing at a software simulation level, the Optimems framework was successfully validated on a real-life demonstration site.

This milestone proves our technology works in the real world — not just in theory.

## CERTH/ITI SmartHome

**CERTH/ITI SmartHome** is the first interconnected microgrid in Greece.

Located in CERTH premises, it's a real-life residential establishment equipped with:

### Infrastructure

- Commercial equipment (inverters, etc.)
- Custom equipment (smart meters, etc.)
- Various smart grid related technologies evaluated for R&D purposes

---

## The Validation

Optimems was deployed on the aforementioned infrastructure and the results were gathered for a period of nine days.

This provided **proof-of-concept** for the microgrid optimal operation.

### The Results

The optimal scheduling of the microgrid assets ensures significant economical benefits, since unnecessary energy imports from the grid are avoided.

---

## Key Results

| Aspect | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Duration | 9 days of continuous operation |
| Validation | Proof-of-concept achieved |
| Economic Impact | Reduced grid energy imports |
| Asset Management | Optimal scheduling confirmed |

## Scientific Publication

The detailed operation of the microgrid across multiple scenarios is analyzed in the following peer-reviewed journal publication:

**["Energies" Journal - MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/10/2752/htm)**

This publication provides in-depth analysis of the microgrid's performance across various scenarios and validates the effectiveness of the Optimems framework in real-world conditions.

---

## Significance

This validation marks an important milestone in the development of our energy management system.

It demonstrates that the Optimems framework can effectively optimize microgrid operations in a real residential environment — not just in simulation.

### From Lab to Life

Moving from software simulation to real-world validation is a critical step.

The CERTH/ITI SmartHome proves our technology works where it matters most: in actual homes, managing real energy consumption.

## What's Next

With successful validation behind us, Optimems is ready to scale.

Our framework has demonstrated its effectiveness in optimizing microgrid operations, reducing energy costs, and improving efficiency.

The future of intelligent energy management is here.
