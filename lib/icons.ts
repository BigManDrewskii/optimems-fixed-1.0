 * Centralized Icon System
 *
 * All icons used across the project are re-exported from here.
 * Import icons from '@/lib/icons' instead of directly from 'lucide-react'.
 * This makes future icon library changes trivial and keeps imports consistent.

 * Usage:
 *   import { Sun, BatteryCharging, Zap, Wind } from '@/lib/icons'
